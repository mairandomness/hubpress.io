<p>My last post was around a month ago, I&#8217;m still working as a teacher and I&#8217;m also quite the procrastinator, so I&#8217;m moving at a somewhat slow pace on this. Which is also fine, I guess (:</p>

<h3 id="_what_s_happening_right_now">What&#8217;s happening right now?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Okay, so Jubs (my partner) was in New York for the last two weeks in The Recurse Center&#8217;s never graduate week and brought me some stuff as gifts~<br>
They have been wonderfully supportive of this whole deal, so much, that in fact, they got me:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Christopher Allen and Julie Moronuki&#8217;s book on Haskell (quite a while ago)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn C the Hard Way from Zed Shawn</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pointers on C from Kenneth Reek</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an iPad Pro for reading ebooks and stuff (as an early birthday gift :D)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>they also lent me their previous notebook which is a quite powerful 15&#8217;dell which is currently running on Linux</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That being said, I haven&#8217;t done much this past month apart from today.<br>
I finished 6.00.2x: Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science
course from edx which was nice, and I can say that I got SO EXCITED that the last set of lectures was about statistical fallacies that I even took a week of classes with my high school students to go over the same basic concepts with them, because I truly believe that being able to identify when data is being twisted is a fundamental skill, especially in a world in which you can be bombarded with so much information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Today in specific I was busy deciding on things to learn over the next months.<br></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the things I&#8217;m doing is going over Learn C the Hard Way, which seems to be a good introductory book on C even though Zed Shawn can be quite excessive when asserting his beliefs, the book does seem to be good. The weirdest thing about it is that it comes with a DVD and it&#8217;s not even an old edition, it&#8217;s from 2016. It&#8217;s just obsolete media&#8230;&#8203; I don&#8217;t even own a DVD reader anymore and I don&#8217;t even know how many years it has been this way. I&#8217;m probably going to take the DVD to the school I work in and copy the files to a pen drive, or something. The second weirdest thing is probably the recommendation of using flash cards to memorize operators and its meanings.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since I decided to go over this book and the author specifies very explicitly that one of the best things you can do if you want to be an actual programmer is not use an IDE, one of the first things was deciding which text editor to go with. I had only used a little bit of Sublime Text before, but not nearly enough to have mastered shortcuts, so I decided to go with Vim, on a Linux machine and also use git to save the projects to access them later (Jubs got on my case about my tossing away a lot of the code I write, that I should keep it instead, even if it&#8217;s silly and quick stuff because it can be useful, so I made a repository of random learning stuff on my GitHub). And since I decided to learn all that new stuff, why not go all the way and work with Linux as well?</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_on_being_a_noob_and_deciding_to_use_vim">On being a noob and deciding to use Vim</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be fair, I did play some of Vim adventures (a puzzle game that was designed to teach you how the shortcuts in Vim work) last year but forgot most of it. I did know already that Vim is awfully counter-intuitive, but if a tool is that weird and still so widely adopted, there&#8217;s definitely something there despite the annoying learning curve. So if I have to master some text editor, it might as well be the one with the weirdest learning curve, so I don&#8217;t have to try and master it after I have a good workflow going on in some other text editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing I did was look around on the internet to get some cheat-sheets ready in a visible location (aka. my wall).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After talking about Vim and it&#8217;s peculiarities with my partner, they mentioned that their coworkers created a configuration for it which is called <a href="https://github.com/stoeffelberg/brangelina">Brangelina</a>. Soon enough we discovered that Brangelina is actually a set of configurations for Neovim, and honestly, it looks pretty good and has some pretty nice plugins. I can&#8217;t express how happy I am that Neovim (unlike Vim) accepts cursor inputs &lt;3<br>
but I am a bit afraid that means I&#8217;m not going to work as hard in trying to memorize the shortcuts&#8230;&#8203; Tradeoffs, right?</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m currently reading a book called "Our souls at night" which is about old people and about making bonds at a very old age. It&#8217;s nice.<br>
These past few weeks I did some crafting, crochet and such.<br>
Basically, a beanie with cat ears and a stuffed octopus while watching shows on Netflix and eating junk food, it did my soul very good.</p>

<p>I spent most of my day yesterday messing around with the iPad, which is one of those devices that I never really thought I would ever want (that was before the apple pencil was a thing). I did get a kindle for e-reading at some point in the past, mostly because I wanted to have access to books in English and because I felt that bright screens were somewhat exhausting. One of the problems of devices like the kindle, however, is that if you read pdfs, it is too tiny to read without zooming in and that can be a bit of a pain.<br>
That&#8217;s basically how the idea of getting an iPad got in our lives, and I&#8217;m interpreting the gift as a very, very supportive message towards me studiyng~</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jubs is a bit on the fence about the idea of attending the ElixirConf, but we are still pretty much set on attending Strange Loop and Papers We Love on the pre-conf day:3</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I will attend the preparatory boot camp (aka piscine) of 42us from August 6th to the beginning of September and I&#8217;m scared shitless of taking that leap of a career path change, but also SO EXCITED.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m unsure of when I&#8217;ll post again. But I will~<br>
See ya soon!</p>

<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I last had a blog&#8230;&#8203; And English is not my first language, so I probably should be spellchecking this&#8230;&#8203; But right now I&#8217;m mostly setting up this blog and looking at how it works in general, and maybe thinking about how to make it look cooler&#8230;&#8203; Maybe I can draw something?</p>

<h3 id="_okay_introductions">Okay.. Introductions?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My name is Maira Kodama, 27 yo.<br>
Born: May 30th, 1989 around 7 PM local time SÃ£o Paulo -SP <br>
I&#8217;m not much of an astrology person, but I like a lot of people that are, so I think it&#8217;s nice to have this out here. <br>
My favorite things about my birthday are:<br>
--- it&#8217;s Saint Joan of Arc&#8217;s day which I personally think is pretty ironic, her being a saint and all<br>
--- it&#8217;s Mikhail Bakunin&#8217;s birthday as well</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m a non-binary person, who usually presents as femme (I accept female pronouns, but I like the neutral ones better). I have a Teaching degree in Mathematics from the University of SÃ£o Paulo and I have been working with education (in a way or another) for the last 10 years.  <br>
Right now, I feel that to continue to be a teacher in traditional schools I&#8217;d suffer too much or become desensitized. I don&#8217;t like any of those options, so I&#8217;m mostly back to studying and trying to understand (as a student) how I feel about less traditional ways of learning, in which I feel like an active agent of my own education, something that never happened before. And this has been amazing so far :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think that feeling competent in your line of work is a great feeling that I really want to have in my life at all times (if possible). I&#8217;m not able to feel like a great teacher.. and worse: I don&#8217;t think that I can become what I consider to be a great teacher right now. So I want to try other things and try to be good in doing them, in the worse case scenario I&#8217;ll become more of a generalist, which is already an amazing accomplishment &lt;3</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_so_what_have_i_been_learning">So&#8230;&#8203; What have I been learning?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mostly programming related things.<br>
I remember how much fun I had doing programming classes in college, it was frustrating but FUN!<br>
I also remember that at the time the work/life balance of programmers was famous for being awful, so I never really wanted to work with it.<br>
But now&#8230;&#8203; I see so many amazing people working in companies that are really great cultural wise. And there are so many awesome ways to learn new things!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_i_have_done_so_far">What I have done so far:</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was never much of a self-driven person and even though I really want to learn new things I&#8217;ve also learned that (for now) structure and deadlines help me accomplish things. I honestly think this is a bad habit that comes with traditional school (even though some people don&#8217;t develop it) and I feel good about trying to deconstruct it without much hurry</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>spent some time learning a <em>little</em> (emphasis on little) bit of javascript, last year I got a scholarship to do Fullstack Academy online, didn&#8217;t go through with it, it was a lot of money and full-time, which would mean quitting my job as a teacher immediately. Beside having mixed feelings about boot camps and how they seem to deliberately make things hard to keep up because allegedly being desperate turns people into better learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an MITx course on introductory programming in python. It was nice, it reminded me from my CS 101 in college, that was in C and it was 10 years ago, didn&#8217;t remember much. I have some prejudice against python and the whole "there should be only one right way of doing things" ordeal, but the syntax is super clean and I have been told that it&#8217;s pretty great for whiteboarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learned a bit on HTML and CSS, bootstrap on freecodecamp and Udacity. I love the way freecodecamp works, don&#8217;t like the exercises too much. But the idea of getting a certificate after you help a non-profit with your newly acquired skills is something that I really like.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_i_am_doing">What I am doing:</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m midway through the second course of MITx, called Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. It still reminds me of college, and it&#8217;s fun (for me at least)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started Udacity&#8217;s Design of Computer Programs that is taught by Peter Norvig, his insights on problems are awesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started an Elm introductory course, didn&#8217;t like the course in particular. But I do want to learn Functional programming and I think that Elm is a good start point, some of the knowledge is transferable to Haskell. So I&#8217;ll finish it eventually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>still going through some things in freecodecamp, never really did any projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decided to keep a blog on this thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got in 42, the piscine sounded <strong>INTENSE</strong> and cool, so I applied. At first, I thought of only attending the piscine. But the idea of doing some of the actual school program is growing on me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_i_really_want_to_do_from_now">What I REALLY want to do from now:</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>read The Imposter&#8217;s Handbook by Rob Conery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read some of  The Good Math by Mark C. Chu-Carroll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn some Lambda Calculus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn some Haskell (?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understand monads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get a better understanding on the whole dealing with C and memory handling ordeal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get better at this self-learning thing. So I can apply to The Recurse Center, which sounds like an awesome place. My husband attended last year and it was an <strong>experience</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess that&#8217;s it for now. I think I&#8217;ll update this eventually, with new wants and in progress things. We&#8217;ll see :3</p>
