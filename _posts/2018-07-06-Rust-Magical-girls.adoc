Last month I drew this and was retweeted by the Rustlang twitter account and I was very much surprised by that!

I have been studying Rust at a leisurely pace since late April when I got to attend a crazy cheap conference with really big names in it. The conference was called BuzzConf and was in Buenos Aires and had talks and workshops by Steve Klabnik, Christopher Meiklejohn <3.

I happened to fall in love with Rust thanks to Steve's workshop and I have been using some learning resources, like:

* http://exercism.io/languages/rust/about[Exercism] - Short exercises that tend to tackle one to a few concepts at a time, it feels pretty rewarding to go through them  and the people involved in making the project are amazing!

* https://tomassedovic.github.io/roguelike-tutorial/[Roguelike tutorial in Rust] - This is a tutorial that is basically a rewrite from another tutorial, that was originally written in Python. It uses the tcod library and it's pretty interesting to follow :) 

* The new rustacean podcast

* https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/second-edition/index.html [The Rust Programming Language Book] - I can't praise this enough. It's REALLY well written and it has some interesting insights on design choices in the language.

== Replanning my year
Right after the Steve Klabnik workshop I kept thinking about the things that I want to do and reworked my plans for the year :D

Which now include attending the Recurse Center to study more Rust :) and apply to Outreachy to work on a Rust project. I have also recently learned about Rustreach, which also made pretty excited and I could do it while having a job <3

I re-applied to attend Recurse Center just last week :3

== Other exciting news

I got a couple of commits in the master branch of a FOSS project!!!
And it felt so validating! The project maintainer was really encouraging and nice, and I literally cried tears of joy when my commits were merged.  The commits were far from being amazing (I was trying to update the dependencies of the project and submit a PR, didn't get that far, just opened an issue and sent the changes I had made so there was no duplicate work) but I really think this one thing is REALLY important! Because even if you feel that your contribution is not amazing, it still is a contribution and feeling the maintainer embracing my changes was awesome!! I hope there are more maintainers like Federico Mena.

I'm not sure if you are a minority in tech. But if you are, there are a number of initiatives that you can benefit from!!!

This year I'm attending two conferences with diversity tickects :D

* Strange Loop through Project Alloy (I only asked for a ticket, but they can offer you a place to stay and airplane tickets for travel inside the US)

*Rustconf through the conference's own diversity program (they only will get you tickets). There's also Rustbridge which is a free workshop for minorities as a preconf event.

== Yet other news

I'm still studying web programing because I will need a job eventually and I know that's where A LOT of the jobs are it doesn't hurt to learn new things.
Even though it's not particularly interesting to learn how to use a framework, I know it gets me closer, even if just a little bit, to learning how the framework actually works under the hood and that sounds amazing!!
