It's been a while since I last had a blog... And English is not my first language, so I probably should be spellchecking this... But right now I'm mostly setting up this blog and looking at how it works in general, and maybe thinking about how to make it look cooler... Maybe I can draw something?

=== Okay.. Introductions?

My name is Maira Kodama, 27 yo. +
Born: May 30th, 1989 around 7 PM local time São Paulo -SP  +
I'm not much of an astrology person, but I like a lot of people that are, so I think it's nice to have this out here.  +
My favorite things about my birthday are: +
--- it's Saint Joan of Arc's day which I personally think is pretty ironic, her being a saint and all +
--- it's Mikhail Bakunin's birthday as well

I'm a non-binary person, who usually presents as femme (I accept female pronouns, but I like the neutral ones better). I have a Teaching degree in Mathematics from the University of São Paulo and I have been working with education (in a way or another) for the last 10 years.   +
Right now, I feel that to continue to be a teacher in traditional schools I'd suffer too much or become desensitized. I don't like any of those options, so I'm mostly back to studying and trying to understand (as a student) how I feel about less traditional ways of learning, in which I feel like an active agent of my own education, something that never happened before. And this has been amazing so far :)

I think that feeling competent in your line of work is a great feeling that I really want to have in my life at all times (if possible). I'm not able to feel like a great teacher.. and worse: I don't think that I can become what I consider to be a great teacher right now. So I want to try other things and try to be good in doing them, in the worse case scenario I'll become more of a generalist, which is already an amazing accomplishment <3

=== So... What have I been learning?

Mostly programming related things. +
I remember how much fun I had doing programming classes in college, it was frustrating but FUN! +
I also remember that at the time the work/life balance of programmers was famous for being awful, so I never really wanted to work with it. +
But now... I see so many amazing people working in companies that are really great cultural wise. And there are so many awesome ways to learn new things!

==== What I have done so far:

I was never much of a self-driven person and even though I really want to learn new things I've also learned that (for now) structure and deadlines help me accomplish things. I honestly think this is a bad habit that comes with traditional school (even though some people don't develop it) and I feel good about trying to deconstruct it without much hurry

* spent some time learning a __little__ (emphasis on little) bit of javascript, last year I got a scholarship to do Fullstack Academy online, didn't go through with it, it was a lot of money and full-time, which would mean quitting my job as a teacher immediately. Beside having mixed feelings about boot camps and how they seem to deliberately make things hard to keep up because allegedly being desperate turns people into better learners.
* an MITx course on introductory programming in python. It was nice, it reminded me from my CS 101 in college, that was in C and it was 10 years ago, didn't remember much. I have some prejudice against python and the whole "there should be only one right way of doing things" ordeal, but the syntax is super clean and I have been told that it's pretty great for whiteboarding.
* learned a bit on HTML and CSS, bootstrap on freecodecamp and Udacity. I love the way freecodecamp works, don't like the exercises too much. But the idea of getting a certificate after you help a non-profit with your newly acquired skills is something that I really like.

==== What I am doing:

* I'm midway through the second course of MITx, called Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. It still reminds me of college, and it's fun (for me at least)
* started Udacity's Design of Computer Programs that is taught by Peter Norvig, his insights on problems are awesome
* started an Elm introductory course, didn't like the course in particular. But I do want to learn Functional programming and I think that Elm is a good start point, some of the knowledge is transferable to Haskell. So I'll finish it eventually
* still going through some things in freecodecamp, never really did any projects
* decided to keep a blog on this thing. 
* got in 42, the piscine sounded *INTENSE* and cool, so I applied. At first, I thought of only attending the piscine. But the idea of doing some of the actual school program is growing on me.

==== What I REALLY want to do from now:

* read The Imposter's Handbook by Rob Conery
* read some of  The Good Math by Mark C. Chu-Carroll
* learn some Lambda Calculus
* learn some Haskell (?)
* understand monads
* get a better understanding on the whole dealing with C and memory handling ordeal
* get better at this self-learning thing. So I can apply to The Recurse Center, which sounds like an awesome place. My husband attended last year and it was an *experience*

I guess that's it for now. I think I'll update this eventually, with new wants and in progress things. We'll see :3
