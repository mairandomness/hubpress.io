<h3 id="_okay_introductions">Okay.. Introductions?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>My name is Maira Kodama, 27 yo.<br>
Born: May 30th, 1989 around 7 PM local time São Paulo -SP <br>
I&#8217;m not much of an astrology person, but I like a lot of people that are, so I think it&#8217;s nice to have this out here. <br>
My favorite things about my birthday are:<br>
--- it&#8217;s Saint Joan of Arc&#8217;s day which I personally think is pretty ironic, her being a saint and all<br>
--- it&#8217;s Mikhail Bakunin&#8217;s birthday as well</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I&#8217;m a non-binary person, who usually presents as femme (I accept female pronouns, but I like the neutral ones better). I have a Teaching degree in Mathematics from the University of São Paulo and I have been working with education (in a way or another) for the last 10 years.  <br>
Right now, I feel that to continue to be a teacher in traditional schools I&#8217;d suffer too much or become desensitized. I don&#8217;t like any of those options, so I&#8217;m mostly back to studying and trying to understand (as a student) how I feel about less traditional ways of learning, in which I feel like an active agent of my own education, something that never happened before. And this has been amazing so far :)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I think that feeling competent in your line of work is a great feeling that I really want to have in my life at all times (if possible). I&#8217;m not able to feel like a great teacher.. and worse: I don&#8217;t think that I can become what I consider to be a great teacher right now. So I want to try other things and try to be good in doing them, in the worse case scenario I&#8217;ll become more of a generalist, which is already an amazing accomplishment &lt;3</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_so_what_have_i_been_learning">So&#8230;&#8203; What have I been learning?</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mostly programming related things.<br>
I remember how much fun I had doing programming classes in college, it was frustrating but FUN!<br>
I also remember that at the time the work/life balance of programmers was famous for being awful, so I never really wanted to work with it.<br>
But now&#8230;&#8203; I see so many amazing people working in companies that are really great cultural wise. And there are so many awesome ways to learn new things!</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_i_have_done_so_far">What I have done so far:</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I was never much of a self-driven person and even though I really want to learn new things I&#8217;ve also learned that (for now) structure and deadlines help me accomplish things. I honestly think this is a bad habit that comes with traditional school (even though some people don&#8217;t develop it) and I feel good about trying to deconstruct it without much hurry</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>spent some time learning a <em>little</em> (emphasis on little) bit of javascript, last year I got a scholarship to do Fullstack Academy online, didn&#8217;t go through with it, it was a lot of money and full-time, which would mean quitting my job as a teacher immediately. Beside having mixed feelings about boot camps and how they seem to deliberately make things hard to keep up because allegedly being desperate turns people into better learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an MITx course on introductory programming in python. It was nice, it reminded me from my CS 101 in college, that was in C and it was 10 years ago, didn&#8217;t remember much. I have some prejudice against python and the whole "there should be only one right way of doing things" ordeal, but the syntax is super clean and I have been told that it&#8217;s pretty great for whiteboarding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learned a bit on HTML and CSS, bootstrap on freecodecamp and Udacity. I love the way freecodecamp works, don&#8217;t like the exercises too much. But the idea of getting a certificate after you help a non-profit with your newly acquired skills is something that I really like.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_i_am_doing">What I am doing:</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m midway through the second course of MITx, called Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science. It still reminds me of college, and it&#8217;s fun (for me at least)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started Udacity&#8217;s Design of Computer Programs that is taught by Peter Norvig, his insights on problems are awesome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>started an Elm introductory course, didn&#8217;t like the course in particular. But I do want to learn Functional programming and I think that Elm is a good start point, some of the knowledge is transferable to Haskell. So I&#8217;ll finish it eventually</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>still going through some things in freecodecamp, never really did any projects</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>decided to keep a blog on this thing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>got in 42, the piscine sounded <strong>INTENSE</strong> and cool, so I applied. At first, I thought of only attending the piscine. But the idea of doing some of the actual school program is growing on me.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_i_really_want_to_do_from_now">What I REALLY want to do from now:</h4>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>read The Imposter&#8217;s Handbook by Rob Conery</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>read some of  The Good Math by Mark C. Chu-Carroll</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn some Lambda Calculus</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>learn some Haskell (?)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>understand monads</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get a better understanding on the whole dealing with C and memory handling ordeal</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>get better at this self-learning thing. So I can apply to The Recurse Center, which sounds like an awesome place. My husband attended last year and it was an <strong>experience</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I guess that&#8217;s it for now. I think I&#8217;ll update this eventually, with new wants and in progress things. We&#8217;ll see :3</p>
